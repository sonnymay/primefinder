# PrimeFinder Project

Welcome to the PrimeFinder Project, a simple and efficient Python script for identifying prime numbers. This project is developed and maintained by `sonnymay`.

## Description

PrimeFinder is a Python script that generates a list of prime numbers up to a user-defined limit. Prime numbers, being integral to number theory and mathematical research, are natural numbers greater than 1 that are not a product of two smaller natural numbers. This script showcases fundamental programming concepts in Python, making it a great educational tool for beginners and enthusiasts alike.

## Features

- Generate a list of all prime numbers up to a specified limit.
- Utilize efficient algorithms for prime number detection.
- Easy to understand and modify, making it a perfect learning tool for Python programming.
